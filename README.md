# Llamaradas Estelares
A flare template [flare_model.py] to model the morphology of white-light flare events. The shape of the flare model is parameterized by the convolution of a Gaussian and a double exponential. Meanwhile, the template can be parameterized by three parameters: amplitude, FWHM, and a center time.
